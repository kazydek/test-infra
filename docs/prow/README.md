# Docs

## Overview

The folder contains documents that provide an insight into Prow configuration, development, and testing.

Read the documents to learn how you to:

- [Configure a production Prow](./production-cluster-configuration.md) based on the preconfigured Google Cloud Storage (GCS) resources.
- [Install and configure Prow](./prow-installation-on-forks.md) on a forked repository to test and develop it on your own.
- [Create a service account](./prow-secrets-management.md) and store its encrypted key in a GCS bucket.

<!-- Update the list each time you modify a document in this folder. -->
